This query helps you track **malicious network flows** in Azure and enriches the data with **geolocation details**. Here’s a breakdown.
---

### **Your KQL Query**  

```kql
let GeoIPDB_FULL = _GetWatchlist("geoip");
let MaliciousFlows = AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL 
| where FlowType_s == "MaliciousFlow"
//| where SrcIP_s == "10.0.0.5" 
| order by TimeGenerated desc
| project TimeGenerated, FlowType = FlowType_s, IpAddress = SrcIP_s, DestinationIpAddress = DestIP_s, DestinationPort = DestPort_d, Protocol = L7Protocol_s, NSGRuleMatched = NSGRules_s;
MaliciousFlows
| evaluate ipv4_lookup(GeoIPDB_FULL, IpAddress, network)
| project TimeGenerated, FlowType, IpAddress, DestinationIpAddress, DestinationPort, Protocol, NSGRuleMatched, latitude, longitude, city = cityname, country = countryname, friendly_location = strcat(cityname, " (", countryname, ")")
```

This query helps you track **malicious network flows** in Azure and enriches the data with **geolocation details**. Here’s a breakdown:

1. **GeoIP Watchlist**:  
   `let GeoIPDB_FULL = _GetWatchlist("geoip");`  
   This loads a geo-location database to map IP addresses to geographic details like country, city, latitude, and longitude.

2. **Filtering Malicious Flows**:  
   The `AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL` table is filtered to identify malicious flows:
   - **`FlowType_s == "MaliciousFlow"`**: Filters the data to only include malicious flows.

3. **Sorting and Selecting Data**:  
   - **`order by TimeGenerated desc`**: Orders the flows by the most recent time.
   - **`project TimeGenerated, FlowType = FlowType_s, IpAddress = SrcIP_s, DestinationIpAddress = DestIP_s, DestinationPort = DestPort_d, Protocol = L7Protocol_s, NSGRuleMatched = NSGRules_s;`**: Selects the relevant fields: 
     - **TimeGenerated**: When the flow was detected.
     - **FlowType**: Type of flow (in this case, "MaliciousFlow").
     - **IpAddress**: The source IP address.
     - **DestinationIpAddress**: The destination IP address.
     - **DestinationPort**: The destination port.
     - **Protocol**: The layer 7 protocol used (HTTP, etc.).
     - **NSGRuleMatched**: Any Network Security Group rules that were triggered.

4. **GeoIP Enrichment**:  
   The query enriches the malicious flow data by using the `ipv4_lookup` function to find geographic details based on the source IP address:
   - **`evaluate ipv4_lookup(GeoIPDB_FULL, IpAddress, network)`** 🌍: This function adds location details (city, country, latitude, longitude) for the source IP address.

5. **Data Projection**:  
   The query then selects the final output fields:
   - **TimeGenerated**: When the flow occurred.
   - **FlowType**: Type of flow.
   - **IpAddress**: Source IP address.
   - **DestinationIpAddress**: Destination IP address.
   - **DestinationPort**: Destination port.
   - **Protocol**: Protocol used.
   - **NSGRuleMatched**: NSG rule triggered.
   - **Latitude** and **Longitude**: Geographical coordinates.
   - **City**: The city associated with the IP.
   - **Country**: The country associated with the IP.
   - **Friendly_location**: A combined label with city and country for better readability.

### Final Output:
This query gives you a detailed view of malicious network flows, including:
- **FlowType** ⚡: The type of flow (malicious).
- **IP Addresses**: Source and destination IPs.
- **Destination Port**: The target port.
- **Protocol**: The type of protocol used.

This query helps analyze Azure activity logs related to resource creation and enriches them with geographic details. Here's a breakdown of how it works.
---

### **Your KQL Query**  


```kql
let GeoIPDB_FULL = _GetWatchlist("geoip");
let AzureActivityRecords = AzureActivity
| where not(Caller matches regex @"^[{(]?[0-9a-fA-F]{8}-[0-9a-fA-F]{4}-[0-9a-fA-F]{4}-[0-9a-fA-F]{4}-[0-9a-fA-F]{12}[)}]?$")
| where CallerIpAddress matches regex @"\b(?:[0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}\b"
| where OperationNameValue endswith "WRITE" and (ActivityStatusValue == "Success" or ActivityStatusValue == "Succeeded")
| summarize ResouceCreationCount = count() by Caller, CallerIpAddress;
AzureActivityRecords
| evaluate ipv4_lookup(GeoIPDB_FULL, CallerIpAddress, network)
| project Caller, 
          CallerPrefix = split(Caller, "@")[0],  // Splits Caller UPN and takes the part before @
          CallerIpAddress, 
          ResouceCreationCount, 
          Country = countryname, 
          Latitude = latitude, 
          Longitude = longitude, 
          friendly_label = strcat(split(Caller, "@")[0], " - ", cityname, ", ", countryname)
```     
---          


1. **GeoIP Watchlist** 🌍:  
   `let GeoIPDB_FULL = _GetWatchlist("geoip");`  
   This loads a geo-location database to map IP addresses to geographic information (like country, city, latitude, and longitude).

2. **Filtering Azure Activity** 🔍:  
   The `AzureActivity` table is filtered to exclude certain caller IDs and only consider valid IP addresses and successful resource creation actions:
   - **`where not(Caller matches regex ...)`**: Filters out logs with GUID caller IDs (usually representing machines or services).
   - **`where CallerIpAddress matches regex ...`**: Ensures the logs only contain valid IPv4 addresses.
   - **`where OperationNameValue endswith "WRITE" ...`**: Focuses on write operations, like creating or modifying resources, and includes only successful activities.

3. **Summarizing Resource Creation**:  
   `summarize ResouceCreationCount = count()` groups the data to count how many resource creation actions took place, grouped by:
   - **Caller**: The user or service making the request.
   - **CallerIpAddress**: The IP address used during the request.

4. **GeoIP Enrichment**:  
   Using the `ipv4_lookup` function, geographic details (such as country, latitude, and longitude) are added to the data by looking up the **GeoIPDB_FULL** watchlist.

5. **Data Projection**:  
   The query then creates a friendly label and selects the fields to display:
   - **Caller**: The name or ID of the user making the request.
   - **CallerPrefix**: The part before the "@" in the caller's user principal name (UPN).
   - **CallerIpAddress**: The IP address used during the request.
   - **ResouceCreationCount**: The count of resource creation actions.
   - **Country**, **Latitude**, and **Longitude** 🌍: Geographic details about the action.
   - **friendly_label**: A user-friendly label combining the caller's name and location for easy reference.

### Final Output:
This enriched query gives you a clearer view of resource creation activity, with geographic context to help identify potential suspicious behavior or patterns:
- **Caller**: Who initiated the action.
- **CallerPrefix**: The caller's name before the "@" symbol.
- **CallerIpAddress**: The IP address used.
- **ResourceCreationCount**: The number of resources created.
- **Country, Latitude, and Longitude**: Location details to map the activity.
- **friendly_label**: A friendly label combining the user's name and location.

This query helps you track resource creation with geographical context, making it easier to spot anomalies or track user activity across different regions.
